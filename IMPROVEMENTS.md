# Improvements & Deferred Fixes

Tracked work to revisit once the Rust/Python port reaches end-to-end parity with the legacy
`FastSpeechProcessing` engine. Nothing here should be "fixed" mid-port - these are reproduced
bit-exactly on purpose so the goldens match.

**Maintainer note:** every phase that reproduces a legacy quirk/bug adds an entry to the Legacy
Quirks section below (what / where / why deferred / fix candidate). See CLAUDE.md for the pointer.

## Legacy Quirks (reproduced bit-exactly; revisit after parity)

- **[0a] adim bias restore vs MATLAB FP path** (`config.rs` `apply_adim`, `weight_bridge.py`): we
  restore the bias to its ORIGINAL value; legacy `config2network.m` computes `(x/adim)*adim`, which
  differs by up to 1 ULP on ~34 biases. We chose original-restore so Rust == Python. *Fix candidate:*
  once the Phase-4 inference golden lands, decide whether strict legacy parity requires replicating
  `(x/adim)*adim` on the bias.
- **[0b-i] CostLaw double-read** (`cost.rs` from `CostLaw.cpp:68-69`): `CostLawThresh{Speech,NoSpeech}`
  is read TWICE -- clamped (`1e-6..1-1e-6`) for the law coefficients, then re-read RAW/unclamped
  (defaults `10.0`/`-1.0`) for the runtime branch predicate. Almost certainly an unintended
  double-read; load-bearing for the sweep goldens. *Fix candidate:* unify to a single, clamped
  threshold after parity.
- **[0b-i] LogLaw cost/deriv Adim asymmetry** (`cost.rs` from `CostLaw.h:119-149`): `cost()` divides
  `y` by `Adim` before clamp+log; `deriv()` clamps the RAW `y` (not divided) then returns `A/y`. The
  derivative is inconsistent with the cost -- a genuine legacy bug. *Fix candidate:* make `deriv` the
  true derivative of `cost` after parity (will shift training gradients slightly).
- **[0b-i] AboveThreshCubic name-dependent coefficients** (`cost.rs` from `CostLaw.h:84-117`): the
  above-threshold cubic law switches its `A`/`B` coefficient formulas on the law-name STRING
  (`square`/`cubic` vs `linear`/`log`). Fragile and surprising. *Fix candidate:* refactor to explicit
  per-law types after parity.

### Forward-noted (add the entry when the phase reproduces it)

- **[0b-ii] `updateSegmentation` tail uses `results.size()` (rows*cols), not `length`** -- correct
  only for a pure row-vector; note when 0b-ii lands.
- **[0b-ii] `suppressShortSegments` no-advance-after-erase** -- re-tests the merged segment; confirm
  intended vs bug at 0b-ii.
- **[3/4] `CostFunctionCalib` nnet_out-before-assignment** (Python optimizer) -- a real
  use-before-assign bug flagged in the setup analysis; fix when the Python training loop is ported.

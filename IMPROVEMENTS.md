# Improvements & Deferred Fixes

Tracked work to revisit once the Rust/Python port reaches end-to-end parity with the legacy
`FastSpeechProcessing` engine. Nothing here should be "fixed" mid-port - these are reproduced
bit-exactly on purpose so the goldens match.

**Maintainer note:** every phase that reproduces a legacy quirk/bug adds an entry to the Legacy
Quirks section below (what / where / why deferred / fix candidate). See CLAUDE.md for the pointer.

## Legacy Quirks (reproduced bit-exactly; revisit after parity)

- **[0a] adim bias restore vs MATLAB FP path** (`config.rs` `apply_adim`, `weight_bridge.py`): we
  restore the bias to its ORIGINAL value; legacy `config2network.m` computes `(x/adim)*adim`, which
  differs by up to 1 ULP on ~34 biases. We chose original-restore so Rust == Python. *Fix candidate:*
  once the Phase-4 inference golden lands, decide whether strict legacy parity requires replicating
  `(x/adim)*adim` on the bias.
- **[0b-i] CostLaw double-read** (`cost.rs` from `CostLaw.cpp:68-69`): `CostLawThresh{Speech,NoSpeech}`
  is read TWICE -- clamped (`1e-6..1-1e-6`) for the law coefficients, then re-read RAW/unclamped
  (defaults `10.0`/`-1.0`) for the runtime branch predicate. Almost certainly an unintended
  double-read; load-bearing for the sweep goldens. *Fix candidate:* unify to a single, clamped
  threshold after parity.
- **[0b-i] LogLaw cost/deriv Adim asymmetry** (`cost.rs` from `CostLaw.h:119-149`): `cost()` divides
  `y` by `Adim` before clamp+log; `deriv()` clamps the RAW `y` (not divided) then returns `A/y`. The
  derivative is inconsistent with the cost -- a genuine legacy bug. *Fix candidate:* make `deriv` the
  true derivative of `cost` after parity (will shift training gradients slightly).
- **[0b-i] AboveThreshCubic name-dependent coefficients** (`cost.rs` from `CostLaw.h:84-117`): the
  above-threshold cubic law switches its `A`/`B` coefficient formulas on the law-name STRING
  (`square`/`cubic` vs `linear`/`log`). Fragile and surprising. *Fix candidate:* refactor to explicit
  per-law types after parity.
- **[0b-i] Softmax `compute_deltas` ponderation-scaling asymmetry** (`cost.rs` `compute_deltas`, from
  `CostLaw.cpp:358-419`): the WER path scales EACH element by its own class's ponderation
  (`_ClassesPonderations(0,kk)`, per `kk`); the non-WER path instead captures a single ponderation
  from the frame's on-class column and scales the WHOLE frame row by it (`deltas.row(jj) *=
  ponderation`, `CostLaw.cpp:417`). The two paths disagree on granularity for no reason apparent in
  the math; reproduced verbatim (see `cost.rs` doc-comment on `compute_deltas`). *Fix candidate:*
  make the non-WER path scale per-element like the WER path, after parity.
- **[0b-i] `suppress_short` no-advance-after-erase** (`src/rust/src/tasks/segmentation.rs`
  `suppress_short`, from `Segmentation.cpp:245-282`): after any erase branch, the loop does NOT
  advance `i` -- the erased slot shifts the next segment into the current index, which must be
  re-tested (a naive `i += 1` would silently drop a merged-in short segment). Confirmed INTENDED:
  the dedicated `suppress_short_no_advance_after_erase` test locks this behavior in. *Why deferred:*
  load-bearing for legacy parity -- changing the advance semantics would change which segments get
  merged/split on real goldens. *Fix candidate:* once end-to-end parity holds, confirm/simplify the
  re-test-after-merge control flow (e.g. an explicit worklist) instead of the implicit no-advance
  loop.

- **[0b-ii] VRCTS writer byte-golden deferred; fixtures are external `vrcts_part` reference input**
  (`segmentation_io.rs` `to_vrcts_string`/`write_vrcts`, from `Segmentation.cpp:543-588`): the engine's
  `toFile_VRCTS` formats `stime`/`etime` with `iof::fmtr("%f.4s")` and `sigdur`/`spdur`/`dur` with
  `%f.2s`. `iof::fmtr`'s `%f.Ns` was resolved (by disassembling the vendored `Debug/bin/fsp` -- the `iof`
  headers are not on disk) to be exactly `std::fixed` + `precision(N)`, i.e. `%.Nf`; the fixture's own
  `sigdur="120.00"` independently confirms `%f.2s` -> 2 decimals. So the faithful writer emits
  **4-decimal** segment times. The committed fixtures (`vrcts_{1seg,empty,16seg}.xml`) instead show
  **3-decimal** times and a `spdur` (16seg: `81.79`) that is NOT the sum of their own printed durations
  (`81.772`): they are external `vrcts_part` output used as engine INPUT via `load_from_vrcts` (which
  reads only `SpeechSegment` times and ignores `spdur`), not `toFile_VRCTS` output. Legacy `spdur` is the
  sum of post-`sanitize` (4-decimal round-half-away, same-type-merged) SPEECH durations over the engine's
  full-precision internal boundaries -- unreproducible from the fixtures' rounded strings. *Validation:*
  `load_vrcts` is golden-tested for load correctness against the 3 fixtures; `to_vrcts_string` is
  unit-tested on a constructed `Segmentation` with hand-computed 4-decimal bytes. *Deferred:* the
  writer-vs-real-engine byte golden waits on the end-to-end inference-output parity milestone (README
  Roadmap Phase 4), when a real engine-produced `.xml` exists to match. *Minor:* our writer sanitizes a
  clone (non-mutating) whereas `toFile_VRCTS` mutates its `_Classification` in place; revisit if any
  caller relies on the write-time sanitize side effect.

- **[0b-ii] `compute_errors` Pass 1b reads one past the ref End sentinel (UB)** --
  `Segmentation::compute_errors` (`Segmentation.cpp:370-382`) sets
  `length = ((long)((itEndRef-1).begin)) / timeStep + 1` (the `(long)` cast is unary and binds to
  `.begin`, truncating the duration to whole seconds BEFORE dividing by `timeStep`; the port
  reproduces this via `begin.trunc()` ahead of the division), so the final `ii` makes `currentTime` land
  exactly on the last ref boundary (= `audioDuration`); the advance loop `(itRef+1 != itEndRef) && ...`
  then walks `itRef` to the End sentinel (`itEndRef-1`), after which line 382
  `durationSeg = (itRef+1).begin - itRef.begin` dereferences the **past-the-end** iterator `itEndRef`
  -- undefined behavior in C++, reading adjacent deque memory. `durationSeg` is only USED in the
  Speech/Substitution and Insertion coverage branches; when `itRef` is at End the flow falls into the
  final `else` (delay-only) branch and `durationSeg` is discarded. *Port:* our Pass 1b defers the
  `it_ref+1` read into those two branches (where `it_ref+1` is always in bounds), giving the identical
  result without the OOB panic. This is a **bounds guard beyond the legacy** (behavior-preserving, not a
  numeric change). *Revisit:* nothing to fix numerically; the guard can stay -- it merely removes UB the
  legacy relied on by luck. Related open item: the Pass-2 `(itRef+1)` / `(it+1)` accesses at
  `Segmentation.cpp:430-446` are guarded in the legacy only by the `!= END` scorable predicate (the
  sentinel makes them unreachable); the port relies on the same predicate rather than adding a redundant
  bounds check.

- **[0b-ii] `update_segmentation` tail uses `results.size()`, not the row `length`** (`segmenter.rs`
  `update_segmentation` tail, from `Segmenter.cpp:833-835`): the legacy TAIL sets `endSegment =
  timeStep*results.size()`, where `results.size()` is `rows*cols` -- correct ONLY for a pure row vector
  (the real SAD input), and wrong for any multi-row matrix. Our port takes a 1-D `results_row: &[f64]`,
  so `results.len()` equals the intended column count and the quirk is structurally avoided for the
  row-vector input; reproduced faithfully because SAD always feeds a single row (this ties to the
  row-vector `update_segmentation` vs col-vector `lid_to_segmentation` orientation asymmetry -- see spec
  3.2/3.3, also load-bearing). *Fix candidate:* if `update_segmentation` is ever fed a 2-D buffer once
  features/NN land, use the column count, not the element count.

- **[phase1] GFFT twiddles: Taylor-seed constants + Numerical-Recipes running recurrence**
  (`features/fft.rs` `sin_series`/`danielson_lanczos`, from `fft.hpp` -- V. Myrnyy, DDJ 2007): the
  butterfly twiddle factors are NOT `libm sin`/`cos`. Each stage seeds `wpr = -2*Sin(N,1)^2`,
  `wpi = -Sin(N,2)` where `Sin(B,A)` is a 16-term truncated Taylor series (`SinCosSeries<2,34>`,
  `S(M) = 1 - ((x*x)/M)/(M+1)*S(M+2)`, base `S(34)=1`), then advances `wr`/`wi` by the NR running
  recurrence `wr += wr*wpr - wi*wpi; wi += wi*wpr + wtemp*wpi;` which ACCUMULATES rounding error across
  the loop. In the legacy these are compile-time template constants; the port computes them at runtime
  with identical f64 operation order (which reproduces gcc strict-mode folding bit-for-bit). A modern
  port would use precise `sin`/`cos` and a non-accumulating twiddle table -- more accurate, but the
  goldens are pinned to this exact (lossy) scheme. *Fix candidate:* after end-to-end parity, swap to a
  precomputed twiddle table using `f64::sin`/`cos`; expect small per-bin numeric drift vs the legacy
  spectrum. Note the DL<4> base case is a hand-fused `-i` butterfly whose STATEMENT ORDER is
  load-bearing (ported verbatim), and the scramble is the 1-based NR bit-reversal.

- **[phase1] Mel deltas-no-DCT output is `[delta | delta | delta-delta]`, static log-mel OVERWRITTEN**
  (`features/mel.rs` `apply_deltas_overwrite`, from `MelFilterBank.cpp:192-193`): when `!DCT &&
  deltasNb > 0`, after computing the delta block (cols `[F,2F)`) and delta-delta block (cols `[2F,3F)`),
  the final two statements do `melPeriodogram = MFCC;` then `melPeriodogram.leftCols(F) =
  MFCC.leftCols(2F).rightCols(F)` -- i.e. the static log-mel block (cols `[0,F)`) is CLOBBERED by a copy
  of the delta block, so the emitted layout is `[delta | delta | delta-delta]`, not
  `[static | delta | delta-delta]`. Almost certainly an off-by-one authoring slip (the static features
  are silently discarded), but it is the golden contract (pinned by `logmel_deltas_chan1.bin`). *Fix
  candidate:* after end-to-end parity, keep the static block (`[static | delta | delta-delta]`); expect
  the NN input dimensionality to be unchanged but the first `F` columns to carry different (real static)
  values -- a retrain-affecting change.

- **[phase1] Mel `adim` denominator includes the clamped `j` when `T <= j`** (`features/mel.rs`
  `regression_deltas`, from `MelFilterBank.cpp:153-170`): the regression-deltas normalizer `adim += j*j`
  runs for every `j` in `1..=n` EVEN when `j > T` (rows) and the shifted-difference copy is skipped
  (`length = min(j, T)`). So on short segments the denominator `2*sum j^2` counts terms whose shifted
  contribution is fully edge-clamped rather than a true `t+/-j` difference. Reproduced exactly (the
  clamped closed form `D[t] = sum_j j*(B[min(t+j,T-1)] - B[max(t-j,0)]) / (2 sum j^2)` matches the
  block-op sequence bit-for-bit, verified against the numpy oracle across `T<=n` shapes). *Fix
  candidate:* none needed numerically; the behavior is self-consistent. Flagged only because it is a
  non-obvious edge that a naive re-derivation (denominator over unclamped active `j` only) would get
  wrong.

- **[phase1] Mel whole-bank fallback: ANY empty filter collapses the ENTIRE bank to raw-band
  pass-through** (`features/mel.rs` `new`, from `MelFilterBank.cpp:92-103`): if a single triangle
  collects zero periodogram bins (`nb_bins` too large for the spectrum resolution), the ctor sets
  `_IsMel = false` and `_NbFilters = _EndFreq - _BegFreq + 1` -- the mel projection is abandoned for the
  whole bank and `applyFilterBank` falls to a raw-band copy/log. The partially built `_IndexBegin` /
  `_Coeffs` are retained but never used. Reproduced faithfully (pinned by the
  `empty_filter_collapses_whole_bank_to_passthrough` test). *Fix candidate:* after parity, either clamp
  `nb_bins` to what the resolution supports or drop only the empty filters instead of the whole bank.

- **[phase1] SDC `ignoreFirst` clobbers the LAST static column, not c0** (`features/mel.rs` `apply_dct`
  Branch A, from `MelFilterBank.cpp:262`): unlike the deltas>=0 `ignoreFirst` path (Branch B) which drops
  the FIRST static (c0), the SDC path writes the `nb_dct` statics first, then assigns the `7*nb_dct`-wide
  SDC band into `MFCC.rightCols(7*nb_dct)`. When `ignoreFirst` the output width is `nb_dct-1 + 7*nb_dct`,
  so `rightCols` starts at column `nb_dct-1` and OVERWRITES the last static (`c_{nb_dct-1}`); c0..c_{nb_dct-2}
  survive. So the discarded static is the highest-order cepstral coeff, not the energy term -- almost
  certainly an authoring slip (the width bookkeeping subtracts 1 for "ignore first" but the write order
  clobbers the last). Pinned by `mfcc_sdc_if_chan1.bin` (c12 == SDC block-0 col-0). *Fix candidate:* after
  parity, either genuinely drop c0 (shift the SDC write right by one) or keep all statics; retrain-affecting.

- **[phase1] DCT `melPeriodogram*_CoeffsDCT` Eigen GEMM replaced by an explicit ascending triple loop**
  (`features/mel.rs` `apply_dct`/`dct_product`, from `MelFilterBank.cpp:223` etc.): the legacy computes the
  DCT projection as an Eigen matrix-matrix product on the full `T x nb_filters` log-mel. The mandatory
  Task-7 harness pre-check (Eigen GEMM vs `for t / for k / accumulate over n ascending`) DIVERGED: Eigen's
  blocked `gebp` kernel does not accumulate in ascending order even under `-DEIGEN_DONT_VECTORIZE`
  `-ffp-contract=off` (e.g. `E(0,0)` bits `...e6ea` vs ascending `...e6ec`; ~1500/2613 elements differ on
  the 201x29 * 29x13 product). Per the brief the product is done as the explicit ascending triple loop, and
  the goldens are dumped with THAT order (harness `dctProduct`), because Eigen's GEMM order is not portable
  across BLAS/arch/Eigen versions. Recorded in `manifest.json:dct_gemm_substitution`. *Fix candidate:* none
  -- the ascending loop is the deliberate portable parity target; do NOT swap in a BLAS `.dot()`.

## Toolchain deviations

- **[phase1] Oracle harness builds with -std=gnu++14, not the plan's -std=gnu++0x** (tools/oracle_harness/build.sh): Homebrew Boost 1.90 and Eigen headers require >= C++14; parity-neutral because bit-exactness is governed by -fno-fast-math -ffp-contract=off -DEIGEN_DONT_VECTORIZE, not the language standard. Also: shims/x86intrin.h redirects to sse2neon so legacy fmath.hpp parses on arm64; fmath is not odr-used by the Task-1 dumps, and the Phase-1 plan double-pins fmath::log via a numpy float32 oracle when it lands. See build.sh comments and .superpowers/sdd/task-1-report.md for full rationale.

### Forward-noted (add the entry when the phase reproduces it)

- **[3/4] `CostFunctionCalib` nnet_out-before-assignment** (Python optimizer) -- a real
  use-before-assign bug flagged in the setup analysis; fix when the Python training loop is ported.
